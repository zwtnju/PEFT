## Requirements

The required Python packages for fine-tuning pre-trained models are listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt), which can be easily installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Fine-tuned Models

All fine-tuned models for every task can be downloaded here: 
[Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1XSIveLO4BYKtFA8Q0hjGQg?pwd=0003).


## Runs
For every task folder, there is a `run.sh` or `run_adapter.sh` script as an example 
to fine-tune pre-trained models. All arguments are located in our paper, specific whatever you need.
